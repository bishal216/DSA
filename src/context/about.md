# About

**DSANotes** is a learning site for Data Structures and Algorithms built around one idea: you understand DSA best when you can actually see it.

The core feature is the **DSA Visualizer tool**. It breaks down complex topics into clear, step by step visualizations so you can follow what’s happening instead of memorizing patterns. You can use the visualizer to understand concepts like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, recursion, sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.

DSANotes also includes structured notes, practical examples, and learning paths designed for coding interviews and software developer jobs, helping you build real understanding and solve problems with confidence.

If you have feedback, suggestions, or want to report an issue, reach out anytime at **support@dsanotes.com**.
